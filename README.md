# appfox-techstack-testing
Unity project for testing technologies, that using for AppFox Unity projects

This is a simple multiplayer game with not simple infrastructure setup. Servers, lobbies and etc.

Concept:
- For every important for me topic (mostly this about packages), I create example sub-project with AssemblyDefinition
	- Every sub-project will contains: test scene, tests and some functionality
- Create final sub-project without AssemblyDefinition - little multiplayer game with this features
	- Clone of Vampire Survivors
	- Server with lobby support
	- All Mirror features: lobbies, commands, server authority...
- Make build (also for Linux), run on my home server and show it for company employees (maybe)
